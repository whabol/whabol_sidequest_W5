## Description
This p5.js project uses example 5, however I iterated the code for it to have a reactive camera experience that automatically scrolls through a world larger than the screen. The player has to 
move the left arrow and up arrow to keep up with the screen. Not keeping up with the screen will result in the blob drifting behind evoking the emotion of feeling sad or tired, wheras clicking the 
up arrow will evoke the background colour to get greener with displays blob being happy and successful.

## GenAI
GenAI was used to help code the reactive camera experience and the background getting greener every time the 
player clicks the up arrow. As well as helping to debug.
